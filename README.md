# Design-Library

The goal of the pattern library is to create reusable, well organized symbols to make prototyping easier. 

The first version collects a few components (like list items, pickers, number slider, etc.) and views (ie. Sign Up, Settings, Lists, and number inputs) 

Check out the sketch file and add feedback about components you'd want in there.
