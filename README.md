# Design-Library beta

The goal of the pattern library is to create reusable and organized symbols to make prototyping fast and easy. 

The first version includes a few components (list items, pickers, number slider, etc.) and views (ie. Sign Up, Settings, Lists, and Number inputs) 

Download the sketch file and add feedback about components you'd want in there.
